# VRUMGPlugin
A compatability layer between UE4 UMG and VR

**Update: In talking with Nick Darnell of Epic it turns out we were both working on a similar system at the same time, he's is a little more integrated into the engine (you can see an example on his [twitter](https://twitter.com/NickDarnell/status/751498173730914304) ), It should be ready for 4.13 or close to it so if you can wait for that I suggest you should if you need it for 4.11 or 4.12 you can still use mine**

This UE4 Plugin allows you to simulate interaction events on a UMG Blueprint Component.
This allows us to easily enable VR input for UMG widgets.
